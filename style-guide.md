# WDL Style Guide

All rules below should be followed by contributors to this repo. Pull Requests which do not conform to these specifications will be asked to change.

## Rules

- Files should have an [SPDX formatted](https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v2.3/using-SPDX-short-identifiers-in-source-files/) Copyright and License information at the top of the page, but below any `wdldoc` header lines (lines starting with `##`)
  - If copyright and license comments are preceeded by `wdldoc` header lines, there should be an empty comment line (`#\n`) between them
- The WDL version declaration should immediately follow copyright and license comments, without any lines separating them
- All import statements should follow the WDL version declaration (with one empty line between the version and the first import statement)
- Import statements should be sorted by the lexicographical ordering of each line
  - No extra white space allowed between symbols or lines
- Variables, tasks, and workflows should be in lowercase "snake_case"
- Declared structs should be in "PascalCase"
- For workflows, the following sections must be present and in this order: `meta`, `parameter_meta`, `input`, `output`
  - `input`, `parameter_meta`, and `output` are technically optional in the WDL spec, though it is discouraged to write workflows in this manner.
    - If `input` is present, then `parameter_meta` must also be present
- For tasks, the following sections must be present and in this order: `meta`, `parameter_meta`, `input`, `command`, `output`, `runtime`
  - `input`, `parameter_meta`, and `output` are technically optional in the WDL spec, though it is discouraged to write tasks in this manner.
    - If `input` is present, then `parameter_meta` must also be present
- The `meta` section should have a `description` of the task or workflow
  - The `description` should be in active voice, beginning the first sentence with a verb
    - Each task/workflow is _doing_ something. The first sentence should be a succinct description of what that "something" is.
- The `meta` section should have an `outputs` key and keys with descriptions for each output of the task/workflow
- Additional `meta` entries are allowed (such as `author` or `email` keys)
- All inputs must have a corresponding `parameter_meta` entry
  - These texts should be copy and pasted from other tasks with the same input when possible
  - Inputs and parameter meta must be in the same order
  - 3 high level input sections
    - first are required inputs
    - second are optional inputs
    - last are inputs with a default value
  - within each section, inputs are ordered by variable type
    - `File`
    - `Array[*]+`
    - `Array[*]`
    - `struct`
    - `Object`
    - `Map[*, *]`
    - `Pair[*, *]`
    - `String`
    - `Boolean`
    - `Float`
    - `Int`
  - for ordering of the same compound type, drop the outermost type and recursively apply above sorting
  - once the above ordering is satisfied, it is up to the developer for final order of inputs of the same type.
  - Disallowed input names: `/^[iI]n[A-Z_]/`, `/^input/i`
    - It is redundant and needlessly verbose to use an input's name to specify that it is an input
- If documenting a workflow, task, input, or output and you need to be more verbose than is appropriate in a `description:` field, you may include _in addition_ an `external_help:` key with a URL
  - `external_help` is _not_ a substitute for internal documentation, although it may allow the internal documentation to be briefer
- `command` blocks should be wrapped with arrows (`<<< >>>`) instead of brackets (`{ }`)
  - Certain Bash constructions cause problems with the bracket notation
- output variable names should be short but descriptive
  - Disallowed output names: `/^[oO]ut[A-Z_]/`, `/^output/i`, `/^..?$/`
    - It is redundant and needlessly verbose to use an output's name to specify that it is an output
- All tasks should run in a persistently versioned container
  - This ensures reproducibility across time and environments
- no whitespace on empty lines
- no whitespace at the end of lines
- indentation should be 4 spaces and never tab literals
- At most one empty line in a row
- There should be an empty line between workflow/task sections and any intermediate declarations
- End the file with a newline
- Comments on the same line as code should have 2 spaces before the `#` and one space before the comment
- Files should not mix `\n` and `\r\n` line breaks
- WDL lines should be less than 90 characters wide whenever possible
  - Exceptions would be long strings that WDL doesn't allow to be broken up
  - This restriction applies to embedded code in the `command` block as well.
- Any tasks which are deprecated should have a `deprecated: true` key in their `meta` section
  - It is allowed (but redundant and discouraged) to include a `deprecated: false` key in any production tasks
  - In addition, the `description` key of deprecated tasks should start with `**[DEPRECATED]**`
    - These two rules allow for a task's deprecated status to be communicated in multiple ways, ensuring no user misses the notice
- Deprecated tasks should be placed at the end of their file
