### Changed

- `util.get_read_groups` had the param `format_for_star` reworked to a more generic `clean` parameter [#205](https://github.com/stjudecloud/workflows/pull/205).
- `star.allignment` now takes an `Array[String]` for `read_groups` instead of a single `String` [#205](https://github.com/stjudecloud/workflows/pull/205).
