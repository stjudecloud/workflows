"""Sort fastq pairs and read group information prior to being passed to STAR.

We discovered that when providing STAR with read group split fastqs and also
supplying STAR with header information via the `--outSAMattrRGline` parameter,
that the read group information for individual reads becomes jumbled.

The simplest solution for this was to first pass exactly what would be passed
to STAR into this program, sort it correctly, and write the reordered
arguments out to files which can be supplied to STAR via the `cat` command.
