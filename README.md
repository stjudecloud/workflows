> This repository contains all bioinformatics workflows used on the St. Jude Cloud project. Officially, the repository is in beta ‚Äî the project is adding workflows as they are developed and put into production.

### üè† [Homepage](https://stjude.cloud)

## Getting Started

At the time of writing, all workflows are written in [WDL][wdl] and are tested
using [Cromwell][cromwell]. We use [Oliver][oliver] to easily interact with the
Cromwell server to perform various tasks. Although we do not test outside of Cromwell, we
expect that the workflows will work just as well using other runners.

The easiest way to get started is to install [bioconda][bioconda] and the run the following commands:

```bash
conda create -n workflows-dev -c conda-forge cromwell==47 -y
conda activate workflows-dev
git clone git@github.com:stjudecloud/workflows.git
cd workflows
```

Any of the workflows in [the workflows](https://github.com/stjudecloud/workflows/tree/master/workflows) folder is a good place to start, e.g.

```bash
cromwell run workflows/reference/bootstrap-reference.wdl --inputs workflows/reference/inputs.json
```

## Repository Structure

The repository is laid out as follows:

* `conf` - Cromwell configuration files created for various environments that we use across our team. Feel free to use/fork/suggest improvements.
* `docker` - Dockerfiles used in our workflows. All docker images are published to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/stjudecloud).
  * At the time of writing, there is only one Docker image heavily in use, which is our [bioinformatics base image](./docker/bioinformatics-base/Dockerfile).
* `tools` - All tools we have wrapped as individual WDL tasks.
* `workflows` - Directory containing all end-to-end bioinformatics workflows.

## Workflows Available

The current workflows exist in this repo with the following statuses:
