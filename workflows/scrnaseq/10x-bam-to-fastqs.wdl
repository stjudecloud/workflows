## # Cell Ranger Bam to FastQs
##
## This WDL workflow converts an input BAM file to a set of fastq files.
## It performs QC checks along the way to validate the input and output.
##
## ### Output:
##
## read1s
## : an array of files with the first read in the pair
##
## read2s
## : an array of files with the second read in the pair
##
## fastqs
## : an array of files sufficient for localizing in Cell Ranger's expected format
##
## fastqs_archive
## : a compressed archive comtaining the array of fastq files
