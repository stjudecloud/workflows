## # Bam to FastQs
##
## This WDL workflow converts an input BAM file to a set of fastq files for read 1 and read 2.
## It performs QC checks along the way to validate the input and output.
##
## ### Output:
##
## read1s
## : an array of files with the first read in the pair
##
## read2s
## : an array of files with the second read in the pair
