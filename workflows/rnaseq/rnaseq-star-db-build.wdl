## # RNASeq STAR DB build
##
## This WDL workflow generates a set of genome reference files usable by the STAR aligner from an input reference file in FASTA format.  
##
## ### Output
##
## reference_fa
## : the reference FASTA file
##
## gtf
## : the reference GTF file
##
## stardb_tar_gz
## : the STAR DB folder in .tar.gz format
