## # RNA-Seq Expression Classification from Counts
##
## This WDL workflow compares counts files to St. Jude RNA-seq samples using 
## a t-SNE plot.
##
## * The count-based RNA-Seq Expression Classification pipeline requires that alignment must be against the [GRCh38_no_alt reference](ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/all/GCA/000/001/405/GCA_000001405.15_GRCh38/seqs_for_alignment_pipelines.ucsc_ids/GCA_000001405.15_GRCh38_no_alt_analysis_set.fna.gz). It should use parameters as specifed in our [RNA-seq workflow](https://stjudecloud.github.io/rfcs/0001-rnaseq-workflow-v2.0.0.html) to minimize any discrepancies caused by differing alignment specification.
## * The count-based RNA-Seq Expression Classification pipeline requires that feature counts be generated with htseq-count as described in our [RNA-seq workflow](https://stjudecloud.github.io/rfcs/0001-rnaseq-workflow-v2.0.0.html). This pipeline uses [Gencode v31](ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/gencode/Gencode_human/release_31/gencode.v31.annotation.gtf.gz) annotations.
