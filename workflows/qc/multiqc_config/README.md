# MultiQC Configs

`multiqc_config.yaml` is recommended for most use cases, as it does not hide or remove any sections or data. However this presents a large amount of data, some of which has overlapping use cases and parsing through all of that can be difficult. The target specific config files have an opinionated set of the "most informative" data for that target (either RNA-Seq, Whole Genome Sequencing, or Whole Exome Sequencing).
