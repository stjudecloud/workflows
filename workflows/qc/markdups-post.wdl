## # MarkDuplicates Post
##
## An investigation of all our QC tools was conducted when duplicate marking
## was introduced to our pipeline. Most tools do not take into consideration
## whether a read is a duplicate or not.
## But the tasks called below produce different results depending on whether the
## input BAM has been duplicate marked or not.
