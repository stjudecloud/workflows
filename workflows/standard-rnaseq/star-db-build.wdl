## Description: 
##
## This WDL workflow generates a set of genome reference files usable by the STAR aligner from an input reference file in FASTA format.  
##
## Inputs: 
##
## reference_fasta - the genome for which to generate STAR reference files in FASTA format 
## gencode_gtf - the gene model file for the reference genome to use when generating STAR reference files 
## stardb_dir_name - a name to use for the output STAR reference directory
##
## Output: 
##
## out_dir - a directory containing the STAR reference files corresponding to the input genome
