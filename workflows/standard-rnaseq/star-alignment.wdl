## Description: 
##
## This WDL workflow runs the STAR aligner on a set of input fastq files.  
##
## Inputs: 
##
## read1s - an array of files with the first read in the pair
## read2s - an array of files with the second read in the pair
## stardb_dir - a STAR reference directory that was generated using STAR genomeGenerate
## output_prefix - the prefix name that should be used to name the STAR outputs
## read_groups (optional) - a list of the read group entries to use in the output BAM from STAR
##
## Output: 
##
## star_bam - the aligned reads in BAM format from STAR
