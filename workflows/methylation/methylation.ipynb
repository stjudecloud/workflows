    "# Methylation Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "The [minfi](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/hansenlab/tutorial.450k/blob/master/inst/doc/methylation450k.html) package is commonly used for methylation array analysis. Normalization is handled by the included subset-quantile within array normalization (SWAN) method. SWAN normalizes methylation array data by selecting a subset of probes from both types (Infinium I and Infinium II).\n",
    "\n",
    "The SWAN publication describes this method thusly:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The SWAN method has two parts. First, an average quantile distribution is determined using a subset of probes defined to be biologically similar based on CpG content. This is achieved by randomly selecting N Infinium I and II probes that have one, two and three underlying CpGs, where N is the minimum number of probes in the six sets of Infinium I and II probes with one, two and three probe body CpGs. If no probes have been filtered out - for example, sex chromosome probes, and so on - N = 11,303. This results in a pool of 3N Infinium I and 3N Infinium II probes. Due to the vast differences in their distributions (Figure 2), the subsequent processing is performed independently on both the methylated and unmethylated channels. The subset for each probe type, from each channel (methylated or unmethylated), is sorted by increasing intensity. The value of each of the 3N pairs of observations is then assigned to be the mean intensity of the two probe types for that row or 'quantile'. This is the standard quantile procedure. The second step is to then adjust the intensities of the remaining probes, of which there are many more Infinium II than I, by interpolation onto the distribution of the subset probes. This is done for each probe type separately using linear interpolation between the subset probes to define the new intensities. Consequently, while the distribution of the subset is identical, the intensity distribution of Infinium I probes is still vastly different from the distribution of Infinium II probes (Figure S2 in Additional file 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "This description suggests that individual samples can be normalized separately since the distribution of each channel within a sample is adjusted based on the subset of probes selected. The only difference between independent runs of SWAN is the selection of the subset of probes. This can be controlled by setting a seed in R (`set.seed(N)`).\n",
    "\n",
    "To facilitate processing of different cohorts of samples, we would like to store normalized values per-sample and then merge as needed for cohort-level analysis. This investigation is to establish that normalizing a single sample is equivalent to normalizing the sample as part of a cohort and demonstrate that the normalization is done per-sample."
